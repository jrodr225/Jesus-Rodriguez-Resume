        <div class="subheading mb-5">History TeacherðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jesus Rodriguez and I have been a history teacher for around fifteen years. I first began to have interest in history during Junior year in high school as I took AP United States History. This class really helped make my decision on to whatr I was going to pursure in college and the teacher that I had at the time really inspired me to take a career path in history.I graduated the University of California, Riverside with a degree in history, with my main focus being on American history. My main focus in history is teaching American History. I have taught history both in middle school and in high school, so I have had experience with students of almost all ages.<br><br>

        I first began teaching American History at Wells Middle School in RIverside, California. I really enjoyed my time teaching history in this school because not only was it the middle school that I attented when I was younger, but I had a very good connection with all the students with I had. After teaching a couple years at wells Middle School, I moved on to teaching at a high school level. The experience seemed to be more smooth since my students were a bit older. My experience at Norte Vista High school was one of the best teaching experiences that I had ever had. The connection with the students was greater than with the students in middle school. I would always try my best to make the topic of American History fun and interesting because many students don't seem to like the subject. My goal everyday was to make students laugh throughout my lectures so they could stay connected to the class. My experience went further than a history teacher. I tried my best to help students with career choices and to my suprise many choose history. I love influencing students not only when it comes to history, but also in life.<br><br>

        I have came to this new high school to seek a new challenge. I want to continue to influence students in a new area and I want to spread the joy that is history. It is really a shame that many people donn't have that love towards history, but I promis I will try my best to influence and spread the love that I have towards history. At the end of the day there are many students that don't know what they are going to do after high school or what career they would like to pursue and help them. Coming into this new new journey I hope you all see the determination and the carenness Ill have towards the new students. Ill feel privlidge to spread the love of history at this new school.
